Project Overview
This project builds and evaluates classification models to automate home loan approval prediction, leveraging features like applicant income, loan amount, credit history, and more. The goal is to streamline the loan approval process using machine learning models.

Dataset
File: loan.csv

Source: Kaggle or bank data (ensure loan.csv is present in the data/ folder)

Sample features:

Gender, Married, Dependents, Education, Self_Employed, ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome, LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, Credit_History, Property_Area, Loan_Status

Preprocessing
Missing values imputed for LoanAmount, Loan_Amount_Term, and Credit_History

Categorical features label-encoded for modeling

Model Training & Evaluation
Splits data into train/test sets (80/20 split)

Trains two models:

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

Evaluates using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report

Requirements
Install Python dependencies using:

text
pip install -r requirements.txt
Requirements include: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

Usage Instructions
Clone this repository.

Place loan.csv inside the data/ directory.

Install dependencies:

text
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the main script:

text
python loan_prediction.py
Results
Prints accuracy and classification report for both models in the console.

Displays confusion matrix heatmap for Random Forest predictions.

Includes example code for new applicant prediction.
